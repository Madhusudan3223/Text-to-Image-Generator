## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Hugging Face Diffusers** – For loading the Stable Diffusion model
- **Transformers** – Tokenizer/model support
- **Accelerate** & **Safetensors** – Optimized model loading and performance
- **Gradio** – Interactive web UI for prompt and image display
- **Hugging Face Spaces** – For free public hosting
- **Google Colab** – Development and testing platform

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📝 Accepts any text prompt (e.g., `"a white tiger in a jungle"`)
- 🎨 Generates high-quality images based on input prompt using **Stable Diffusion**
- 🧑‍💻 Simple UI built with **Gradio**
- 🌐 Live and public deployment using Hugging Face Spaces
- 🔐 Token securely managed via secret settings

---

## 🔐 Authentication

A **Hugging Face access token** is required to use the model.

- The token is **securely added** through the Hugging Face **"Secrets" tab** in your Space settings.
- This ensures safe model access without exposing your credentials.

---

## 🌐 Deployment

- ✅ **Hosted** on Hugging Face Spaces  
- 📎 **Accessible** via public link (can be shared)  
- 💻 **Works on both laptop and mobile**  
- 🕒 On **free CPU hardware**, generation may take **5–10 minutes**, especially during peak hours.

---

## 📷 Example Output

**Prompt**: `"A sunset over the mountains"`  
**Result**: High-quality AI-generated image of a scenic sunset landscape 

---

## 📎 Limitations

- 🐢 Slow generation on **free CPU tier**
- 📱 Queue delays on mobile devices
- ⚠️ Not optimized for real-time image generation unless upgraded to GPU

---

## ✅ Status: Completed

The app has been successfully deployed and is fully functional.

Anyone with the Hugging Face link can use it to generate images from text prompts.  
Great for showcasing:
- Generative AI
- Diffusion Models
- Gradio + Hugging Face integration
